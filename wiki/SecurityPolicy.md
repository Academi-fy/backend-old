## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability in Academi-fy, please take the following steps:

1. **Do not disclose the issue publicly.** We want to ensure that our users have a chance to update before the vulnerability becomes public knowledge.

2. **Report the issue to us directly.** Please email us at [academi.fy@icloud.com](mailto:academi.fy@icloud.com) with details of the vulnerability. The more information you can provide, the better. This will help us diagnose and fix the issue faster.

3. **Do not attempt to exploit the vulnerability yourself.** This includes attempting to "test" it, or "see what happens". We take the security of our users very seriously, and any attempts to exploit a vulnerability will result in an immediate ban.

Once we receive your report, we will:

- Acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report
- Work to confirm the existence of the vulnerability
- Keep you informed about our progress

We strive to resolve all issues as quickly as possible, and we will strive to keep you updated every step of the way.

## Policy for Security Updates

When a version of Academi-fy is no longer supported, it means that we will not provide any security updates for that version. We strongly recommend that all users upgrade to the latest supported version to ensure they are receiving all security updates.
